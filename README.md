# Aloompa Coding Challenge: GraphQl API

### Description:

Create a GraphQL API to query apps, events, and stages using this [data set](https://assets.aloompa.com.s3.amazonaws.com/rappers/hiphopfest.json).

Your project must use Node (TypeScript or JavaScript) for the query resolvers. You may use any libraries or frameworks as dependencies, but the code inside the project must be your own.

### API Requirements:
- [x] You should be able to list all of the apps
- [x] You should be able to query a single app
- [x] You should be able to list all the stages
- [x] You should be able to query a single stage
- [x] You should be able to search the stages by name
- [x] You should be able to list all of the events
- [x] You should be able to query a single event
- [x] You should be able to search the events by name
- [x] You should be able to query the events that occur between two dates
- [x] You should be able to list all of the events in an app
- [x] You should be able to list all the stages in an app
- [x] You should be able to get the stage in an event
- [x] You should be able to list the events at a stage
- [x] You should be able to add, update and remove all entities

### Extra Credit:
- [ ] Your project is deployed to AWS ([JavaScript & AWS Solution Here](https://github.com/thejmdw/graphql-challenge))
- [x] Your repo has a README
- [x] You use TypeScript

# Problem Encountered

Attempting to deploy to AWS using Serverless yields the following error: 

```
serverless deploy --stage prod

Running "serverless" from node_modules

### Steps to Recreate Problem
 1. ```git checkout thejmdw-aws```
 2. ```serverless deploy --stage prod```

### Google
Google lead me to this [issue](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/9187) on the Serverless Repo.

Which lead me down a rabbit hole of these [issues](https://github.com/serverless-heaven/serverless-webpack/issues?q=depth) on the Serverless-Webpack Repo.

### Solutions I tried:

1. removing ```package-lock.json``` & ```node_modules``` and using ```npm install``` to reinstall the dependencies
2. updating to latest ```serverless-webpack``` & ```webpack``` versions
3. changing the node.js ```provider.runtime``` in the ```serverless.yml``` from ```nodejs12.x``` to ```nodejs14.x```
